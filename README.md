### Internship project 

It's a REST service built using Java and the popular Spring Boot framework, along with Hibernate for database interactions and JUnit for testing.
I worked on this project during my summer internship of 2022. The best part is that the knowledge and skills I gained from this project are still benefiting me in my job today.

System description: A system for employees to track their work. It includes three user roles: admins, managers, and employees, each with specific permissions for actions.
